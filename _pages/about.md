I am a Ph.D. candidate at University of California, Irvine. I work on machine learning methods in biology with a strong interest in integrating systems and structural biology with applications in drug discovery. Given the complexity of biological data, I seek to combine biological data into more robust machine learning models to reduce entropy of biological sytems. A key aspect of this is in Bayesian optimal experimental design, which helps us decipher between competing biological hypotheses with maximum efficiency.

So far, the main software from my Ph.D. work is the JAX-based conditional normalizing flow library [LFIAX](https://github.com/vz415/lfiax) with experimental design loss functions.  

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
