I am a Ph.D. candidate at University of California, Irvine. I work on machine learning methods in biology with a strong interest in integrating systems and structural biology with applications in drug discovery. Given the complexity of biological data, I seek to combine biological data into more robust machine learning models to reduce entropy of biological sytems. A key aspect of this is in Bayesian optimal experimental design, which helps us decipher between competing biological hypotheses with maximum efficiency.

So far, the main software from my Ph.D. work is the JAX-based conditional normalizing flow library [LFIAX](https://github.com/vz415/lfiax) with experimental design loss functions.
